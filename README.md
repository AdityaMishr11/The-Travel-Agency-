# The-Travel-Agency-
It contains my very first project named travel agency that I developed in Turbo C++ 


This project is a **Turbo C++ console-based application** designed to streamline travel booking operations. It incorporates functionalities like:

- **Hotel Bookings**: Allows users to reserve accommodations seamlessly.
- **Vehicle Rentals**: Provides a module for booking vehicles for travel needs.
- **Trip Itineraries**: Enables management of custom travel schedules.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Features secure access for administrators to oversee operations.
- **File Handling**: Efficient data management using C++ file handling techniques.
- **Interactive UI**: Incorporates ASCII art and an interactive menu system for a user-friendly experience.

This system is built with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and focuses on enhancing operational efficiency for travel agencies.
